It had a clean and even set of teeth. Before I thought about it, I reached to pluck one of them out. It took me a second to choose the right one. It jiggled in place, but was firmly attached. After some pulling, tugging, and swearing, it came loose. The sun had warmed the tooth and it had an unfamiliar shape and texture. I placed it in the pocket of my camera bag and it’s been there since. I tend to forget about it, but every now and then I reach in to look for a coin and meet its sharp edges. It takes me a second to recognize what it is; then I remember the horse from Magdalena. It’s a friendly reminder that we should show our teeth as much as possible. Who knows how much longer we are gonna have them.</p></span><!--End Text Block--></div></div></article>

A local friend of his has set him up here, saying the hotel was clean and cheap.<br><br>It is indeed cheap, forty-five dollars a night, but it does not seem safe. The locks on the doors do not work, and the clerk sits behind bulletproof glass. The man’s room is small and smells of paint, and the outlets don’t work, so he goes down to the hotel bar, which is unadorned and empty.<br><br>He orders a gin and tonic from the Kenyan bartender, who is wearing a red vest and white shirt and black bowtie. The visitor drinks his first drink down, feeling sad about so many things, wanting to be home, wanting to be doing something else, and then orders another. He takes this second drink and, not wanting the bartender to feel compelled to talk to him, he walks to the other side of the bar and sits in front of a large flat-screen television. There is a music video on, in which eight African women in traditional clothing are singing and playing instruments. The song is jangly, buoyant, joyous.<br><br>The man goes back to the bartender to ask who the band is, this all-woman band in the music video. The bartender says he has no idea, so the visitor goes back to his seat and finishes watching the music video. When it’s done, he sees the name of the band on the bottom left corner, writes it down, and finishes his drink. He looks up to find the bartender at his side.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--></div></div><div class="container"><div class="twelve columns offset-by-two"><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>Everywhere in the world, men who are alone or who seem alone get off airplanes or leave their hotels, and they get in taxis, and they ask the drivers of these taxis to take them to bars, or nightclubs, or to hear live music. And these taxi drivers, without heed and almost without exception, take these men to brothels.<br><br>Once, in Bangkok, accompanying a few friends, one much older Russian and one younger American, both of whom thought the whole enterprise—the brothels, Thailand, life altogether—absurd, the visitor found himself in a nightclub where young Thai women danced on steel stages and whose attentions could be rented by the hour. A slightly older Thai woman, holding a clipboard, urged the visitor to spend some time with a young woman in the back room, and the Russian said, “Do it, do it,” and laughed maniacally.<br></p></span><!--End Text Block-->

The young woman was tiny, shy of a hundred pounds, and led him through a series of narrow hallways, everything lit indigo, and into a white room. She closed the door. On one half of the room there was a shower, white-tiled and so big a dozen people could wash themselves at once. On the other side of the room there was a kind of bed, high like one found in a medical examination room, with a plastic white mattress.<br><br>The young woman motioned him to sit, and he did. She quickly disrobed, revealing a body that looked much like the man’s own, at age twelve. With a stern downward motion, she suggested the man take his clothes off too, but he disabused her of any obligations to work his flesh. He told her he would still pay her for her time, but he wanted only to sit and rest and talk. She understood immediately; it was not an unusual turn of events, it seemed, for a visitor to want no part of the whole thing, to instead want to buy an hour of respite for them both.

There was a jambú tree in our condominium, which dropped its fruit on the cobblestone path near the swimming pool.&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Even the marmosets that lived in the trees turned up their noses, spoiled by the cookies and bits of ripe banana that the children fed to them.</p><p><br></p><p>In a tropical climate, many fruits are available year round: papayas, bananas, jackfruit. The plants are hardy, amenable, long-suffering. They give and give and give. Modern commerce makes up for much of the rest; as in most places in the world now, you can go to the supermarket and buy apples shipped in from Chile and kiwis from New Zealand.&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>But many other fruits are rare and seasonal, impossible to find except for during a small window of the year. They aren’t cultivated anywhere else, at least not on a scale that would warrant import and export. Most wouldn’t transport, anyway. Many are harvested from wild stands and, being undomesticated, are shy, temperamental, difficult to control. Indoors, they spoil quickly, or lose their vibrancy, turn sullen in a bowl on the counter, refuse to ripen.</p><p><br>The jambú, or water apple, one source declares, is consumed mainly by children. Perhaps adults have lost the taste for them, spoiled by expectations of what a fruit should taste like. Or we’ve lost the elemental pleasure in picking a fruit from the tree or the ground and eating it, a satisfaction whole and complete in itself, one that eclipses the actual taste of the fruit.&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Our nanny, Dete, showed my children how to eat jambús. When they ripened and began to fall she took them to the tree, showed them how to find a good one—not too hard, not too soft. To check for rot, to rub it on the hem of their shirts before biting into it.<br></p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Pullquote Block (column)--><blockquote class="align-full"><p>She alighted, breezy and pragmatic, on the low wall of the veranda, and took the baby on her lap.</p></blockquote><!--Pullquote Block (left)--><!--Pullquote Block (left-breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (right breaking)--><!--Pullquote Block (breaking)--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>She came to work for us two days after we arrived in Brazil.

I would rise in frustration and in awe at the gentle, early light, the jambú tree outside spreading its blossoms like small bright-pink asterisks across the ground.<br><br>What did it mean to be a foreigner? I had chosen this, and in truth there were many aspects of it that I enjoyed. It gave a name to the feeling of exile. It justified the oddness, the slight out-of-synchness I have felt—that surely everyone feels, one time or another—everywhere. It gave a thrilling, manic edge to the most quotidian routines. It made me see things with new eyes: grocery stores and traffic jams, trees and flowers.<br><br>The jambú tree flowers on both the trunk and the branches, florescent pink puffballs that disperse in the breeze like confetti.&nbsp;<br><br>A German naturalist traveling in Brazil in the 1930s wrote, “[It] was always a pleasure, when I left the monastery garden for the street, to pass through an alley of Jambo-trees, which, with their crimson flowers, set like candles on the branches and glowing in the green foliage, looked as though they had been illuminated.”<br><br>We had only one tree, but I can imagine a row of them, and how they might provide a sort of luminescent passageway from one space to another, from the cloistered abbey to the street.<br><br>Little cultural attention has been given the water apple. Where are the odes to the water apple, the songs and paeans, the biography of its thick petioles, its crooked trunk and open crown?<br><br>Where are the jambú orchards, the fields of dull, light-green foliage, the fruit thin-skinned and shining on the branches?<br><br>Also known in English as water apple, or watery rose apple, the appeal of the jambú is largely its thirst-relieving character.
It is a blank, a placeholder. Small aqueous globe onto which you draw your own map: continent, coastline, tortuous passage.<br><br>We were nowhere near the pampas (which are in Argentina and southern Brazil, thousands of miles from Salvador), but does it matter? Dickinson’s butterfly—like Dickinson’s Brazil—is a mythical creature, an exquisite apparition.<br><br>Dickinson is an exact geographer, but she’s no tour guide to South America. Her maps of dark places are ethereal, made of light and feathers, gossamer and tulle.<br><br>For a more concrete cartography, I turned not to the Rough Guide or Lonely Planet, which always seemed useless, out of date, too obvious or too obscure, but to the early explorers.</p></span><!--End Text Block-->

<span style=""><p>Though perhaps there’s not much difference between Cabral or Darwin on the storm-tossed Atlantic and Dickinson in her Amherst attic, embarking on the great scow of her imagination.<br><br>Or Alexander von Humboldt, who, on a voyage to this same continent in 1799, wrote:<br><br>A strange, completely unknown feeling is awoken in us when nearing the equator and crossing from one hemisphere to another… The stars we have known since infancy begin to vanish.<br><br>“And new ones appear, blinking on slowly, in the gentle equinoctial dark.”<br><br>
In my small Brazil, I gathered the wild fruits that Dete named for me: jambú, sapotí, pitanga. They provided a map of sorts, too—a chart of seasons and the subtle shifting of the light; of trees and bushes; of childhood, that undomesticated realm of hiding places and negotiations.<br><br>The jambú is almost always eaten out of hand—an impulsive find, sweet afterthought, windfall. But if you take a knife to it, press a deliberate blade against its skin on the cutting board, a cross-section of the fruit reveals a luminous cavity spoked with seeds, a hollow star.</p></span>

Jim Hamilton arrived around five on a seaplane. A class act. He arrived with the normal amount of luggage and fishing equipment beyond belief: two rods and a steamer-trunk-sized tackle box. The first thing he did after getting settled was to go off to the end of the dock and give it a try. He caught four “chub,” but since they are junk fish he squeezed them to crush their air sacs. Later in the afternoon we saw an osprey carry off one of the dead fish. Dinner of chicken and rice and a cake for Honor as we celebrated her birthday with champagne brought in by Jim. Pretty chilly tonight, so all in by fire in living room.</p><p><br><strong>Saturday, August 5</strong></p><p>Not much of a wind, broken high clouds and sun threatened by a dropping thermometer.

Nothing, of course, but we did see an extraordinary sight at the other end of the lake which we couldn’t figure out. Honor pulled out a pair of binoculars and saw that it was Meg and Edward Copsey rowing to camp in a dinghy that Edward pulled out of lower camp’s kitchen. Edward arranged two long bamboo poles and at the top of the makeshift mast he’d hung a large Union Jack. It was an amazing sight and reminded me of the German ship on the lake in The African Queen. Their colorful arrival was met by a reception flotilla of Honor, Jim, and I in an outboard and Charlie and Tish with Anna and Andrew in a canoe. Edward immediately took charge in the kitchen and we switched from half-gallon to gallon bottles of wine.

Rather than visit and pose next to typical attractions, we find our own hidden treasures and highlight them in different ways. We’re after urban legends, local eateries, secret trails and hidden gems. We play with our cameras and go on filmmaking missions, like shooting bicycles riding past timeless architecture or filming each other’s backs while strolling through town or exploring a trail.

Because he couldn’t get all the dog hair off the passenger seat, he covered it with a coat. Like a Frenchwoman from the historical past, Neutrino often applies perfume instead of bathing. He uses the cheapest fragrances, typically ones he buys at a drugstore. We would be crossing the Mojave Desert. Neutrino thought that he could cool the car for us by filling the interior with ice. He bought four plastic laundry baskets and put them in the back, beside his bed.

By the time we reached Palm Springs, the day was hot. The sky was a pale blue. Neutrino said that what he had loved about the Bedouin’s life he had lived in the desert was that you wake up and start to move. On the dashboard was a paperback copy of the Bhagavad-Gita. The dog sat between us, on a blanket. Now and then, Neutrino would pour water on the dog. The water would splash on me, but I don’t think he knew it, because he was watching the road. Then he would pat the dog and more water would fly off her. Then the dog would shake. Neutrino fell in behind the slowest-moving truck on the road. He figured that any vehicle coming toward us that crossed into our lane would hit the truck. Cars passed us going so fast that it was as if they were fleeing something. Every few minutes, Neutrino would stick one hand through the curtain between the seats. “Yeah, that’s working,” he’d say. “I can really feel it cooler now. You feel it?” The water leaked onto the floor and made the red dye on the side of my canvas in-flight bag run over everything inside the bag and stain it red, but I didn’t know that until later. About once an hour we would stop and empty the water from the plastic bags, and every two hours we would buy more ice.&nbsp;<br><br>In the desert there were so many high-tension wires that they divided the sky like lines on sheet-music paper. We crossed bridges over dry rivers. The riverbeds and the land around them were the color of linen and looked more like beaches than riverbeds.

A handsome, dark-haired Mexican woman was sweeping a porch in front of the door, and when we turned into the parking lot, she leaned her broom against the doorframe and stepped inside. A man with black hair and a face the color of tobacco met us. Neutrino said, “Remember me?” The man smiled and said hello. “I just wanted to show my friend the raft,” Neutrino said. “That all right?” We followed the man through the door, into a small, sleepy store that sold toys and children’s clothes and CD’s of Mexican singers and drinks, then through another door into a garage that had tires and tools spread around it, then into another dusty lot where there were a few trucks and beat-up and broken-down cars and, on a trailer, like a rare bird among a flock of sparrows, Neutrino’s raft.

I expected a sleek, handmade craft, a stylish vessel, varnished and elegant, a craft to bear up to the life-and-death task being asked of it, and it was a scrappy, scuffed-up, bummy looking, broken-down wreck of doghouse on a floor of plywood. It looked like something a child had made. It had a flat bed, and there was a cabin about four feet tall at the back of it, and in front of the cabin a deck large enough for Neutrino to sit in a folding chair. No joint was tight. Where there were gaps, you could see pieces of drink coolers. Some of the plywood was new and some was splintered and peeling and had weathered to a dark gray. The back of the cabin was cut from a sign that Neutrino had painted in Key West for Katha Sheehan, a woman he met who was running for mayor. Sheehan and her husband had given him his van and his dog. Dark yellow letters on a yellow ground spelled “atha for ayor.” Screws were driven into the boards at angles, and the intervals between them were uneven.</p></span><!--End Text Block--><!--Photo Block (column)--><div class="align-breaking-left"><!--This containing div will give us better contol of an accompanying caption once we add them--><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/33q68q5bSp6bH3YT5CcA?signature=b27ff19f30657670f4edca9056ed3841ed4d69374c3034ba8f4b57f9a363d47c&policy=eyJjYWxsIjogWyJyZWFkIiwgImNvbnZlcnQiXSwgImV4cGlyeSI6ICIyNTI0NjU4NDAwIn0=" class="" /></div><!--End Photo Block--><!--Photo Block (left)--><!--Photo Block (right)--><!--Photo Block (left breaking)--><!--Photo Block (full width) NOTE: all blocks with full-width alignment specified need to break the .twelve and .container divs temporarily as shown below--><!--Photo Block (right breaking)--><!--End Photo Block--><!--Text Block--><span style=""><p>“How long did it take to build?” I asked.<br><br>“About four hours,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>I nodded.&nbsp;<br><br>“I designed her for speed,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>I wrote “Speed” in my notebook, then I underlined it, because I couldn’t think of anything to say.&nbsp;<br><br>“She’ll ride high in the water, just plane,” he said.

We got back in the van and drove toward Phoenix, and when we saw a motel from the highway I said, “That looks OK,” and we pulled off and I got a room. We ate dinner in a Mexican restaurant where there were a lot of families and a man who went around the room playing guitar and singing.

On the left hand side of the page, he is saying, “I have money, I have papers, I have seclusion, what will stop me? &nbsp;I have to be careful nobody steals Boop, or the engine.” &nbsp;Boop was his dog, a female Boston terrier. On the right hand page he is expressing a core Neutrino belief. “I don’t want an OK life. I’m not even sure what it is. I’m into Wow, and if I can’t have it, I don’t even want to be around for an OK life.” Beneath the line it says, “I don’t want to see what happens when I get on this raft...” Neutrino hated surprises. He tried to plan so carefully as to eliminate them.&mdash;<span class="italic">Alec Wilkinson</span></p></em></span><!--End Text Block--></div></div></article>
